In partnership with **Singapore Press Holdings**

*S$202,000 to fund a year-long concert series for the community.*

**About the Project**

The Gift of Music Series in 2005 was SPH's contribution towards enriching the community with music through a year-long series of concerts held monthly at the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, and other venues.

It enabled the spread of the appreciation of music and at the same time leveraged on the Shaw Stage as a concert platform for home grown musicians and budding young performers to showcase their talents.

The concert performances showcased diverse genres, ranging from jazz, Latin, and light classical to pop, R&B and Chinese orchestral music.

The addition of such outreach activities attracted more people to visit the Gardens and provided them with an enhanced experience.

In partnership with **Shell**

*S$10,000 donated yearly since 2007 to fund programme.*
  
**About the Project**  
Nature Nurtures is a successful ongoing mentorship programme for secondary school students. Initiated by NParks and supported by Shell, the programme brings mentors and mentees on a journey of discovery through nature-based activities.  
  
The programme aims to motivate teens to contribute positively to society, through skills that physically and mentally challenge them, and activities that are based on confidence and team building in a nature setting. Students have participated in various activities such as archery, coastal clean-ups, mangrove salvaging and water parameter testing.  
  
Since its inception in 2007, Nature Nurtures has touched the lives of more than 100 students from Chestnut Drive Secondary School, Shuqun Secondary School and Northlight School.

**About the Project**  
The Singapore Garden Festival is a biennial show, positioned to be among the top flower and garden shows on the international calendar. The Festival brings together the world's top award-winning garden and floral designers to Singapore to showcase their masterpieces. Singapore's geographic location makes the Festival an ideal platform to showcase horticultural and gardening products and services from Asia, Americas, Europe and Oceania. The Festival has attracted increasing number of visitors from Singapore and around the world since its inaugural show in 2006.  
  
Singapore Garden Festival has enjoyed extensive local and international media coverage. Our sponsors and partners have benefited from the intense media build-up in terms of brand awareness and reach to their target audiences. The Festival also provides a myriad of branding opportunities for companies seeking to connect with their audiences.

The Nature Keeper Programme was the first programme in Singapore to target primary school students with a focus on our local forests and its flora and fauna.

The two-year programme (2010-2012) brought students through a series of theoretical and field workshops on eight topics. These topics covered the impact of the release of animals in nature reserves, the native plants and animals unique to Singapore, the importance of forests in regulating climate, and more.

Designed to stimulate the interest of the young and inculcate in them an appreciation of our forests, the programme was carried out at the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves.

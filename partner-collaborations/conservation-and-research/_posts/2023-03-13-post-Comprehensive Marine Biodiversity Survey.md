The Comprehensive Marine Biodiversity Survey (CMBS) was initiated by a proposal from the Blue Plan Group which was submitted to the Singapore government in 2009. It was agreed that Singapore should conduct a comprehensive survey to document all of our marine life in all of our natural marine habitats.

Apart from taking stock of Singapore's marine biodiversity, CMBS also aims to build local capacity in the field of marine biology, spread awareness and increase appreciation of our marine natural heritage.

Led by the NParks, the survey brings together experts and partners from tertiary institutions (National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University), non-governmental organisations (Blue Plan Group, Nature Society Singapore) and volunteers from the community at large.

Launched in November 2010, the CMBS will be carried out in phases over five years. Some 350 local volunteers have contributed in various aspects of the CMBS, including photography, outdoor field sampling and collection, specimen processing, database support as well as organising outreach programmes.

As of May 2013, the project has collected some 30,000 specimens through surveys conducted in mudflats, seabeds and reef habitats. Of these, 14 species have been identified as possibly new to science, more than 80 new records for Singapore have been found and about 10 species have been rediscovered.

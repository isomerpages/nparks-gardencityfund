NParks carried out the first mangrove biodiversity monitoring study in Pasir Ris Park's mangrove forest. The study, which commenced in March 2012, consisted of 16 biodiversity monitoring sessions conducted over two years. It included the monitoring and data collection of mangrove trees, snails and mudskippers.

Results of the study study enabled the collection of valuable information to aid long-term conservation and management of Singapore's mangrove forests.

Covering an area of 6 hectares, the mangrove forest at Pasir Ris Park is one of the few mangrove sites left in Singapore. It is also a popular attraction – scores of nature lovers and families visit the mangrove forest every month to experience and learn about its rich biodiversity.

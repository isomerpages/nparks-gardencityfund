Named the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden in appreciation of the donation from Jacob Ballas Trust Fund, it is designed to provide young visitors a unique discovery and learning experience in a garden setting.

Through play and exploration, the Children's Garden cultivates an appreciation for plants, nature and the environment.

Developed along the theme "All Life on Earth Depends on Plants", it was planned as a unique and interactive fun place where children up to 12 years of age could learn about life sciences and discover the process of plant growth.

The Jacob Ballas Children's Garden has an annual visitorship of more than 200,000. To further its outreach to the community, the Children's Garden has set its sights on increasing its capacity and engagement to older children up to 14 years old.

The estimated cost of expanding the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is S$4.5 million. This is made possible by NParks and the generous support of the Jacob Ballas Trust Fund.

*S$12,000 to set up a butterfly garden at Alexandra Canal Linear Park.*

**About the Project**

The Butterfly Garden, about half the size of a basketball field, houses a wide array of plant species to attract butterflies, and offers a visual treat for nature lovers and enthusiasts. These plants included Lantana camara (host plant), and several nectar plants such as Asystasia gangetica, Arachnothryx leucophylla, and Ixora Javanica 'Red'. This is also one of many initiatives to infuse more biodiversity into the city's urban environment.

The Garden's star-shaped design was inspired by the winning entry submitted by Serangoon Secondary School in a design contest.

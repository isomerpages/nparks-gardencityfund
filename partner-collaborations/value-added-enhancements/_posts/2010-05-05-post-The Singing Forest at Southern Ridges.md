In partnership with **ST Microelectronics**

*S$150,000 to implement the planting efforts to create a forest that birds would be attracted to, and related educational initiatives for public.*

**About the Project**

**![stm event 01](https://www.gardencityfund.gov.sg/-/media/gcf/projects/value-added-enhancements/stm_event_01.ashx)**

The Singing Forest is part of the NParks' plans to enhance biodiversity within our urban areas. Showcasing 38 native tree species that originally dominated our regional landscape before urbanisation, the Singing Forest project will intensify the already high diversity of native bird species in the Southern Ridges.

Visitors to Southern Ridges will, in time to come, enjoy a wonderful chorus of birds singing at dawn when the collection of bird-attracting tree species is established.

Care has been taken to select the native tree species from four botanical families that will provide a wide variety of suitable food sources as well as shelter and nesting areas for native birds. When established, the additional planting of suitable tree species will eventually provide an opportunity for visitors to learn and appreciate the diverse collection of birds and trees in Singapore.

STMicroelectronics's contribution supported the costs of implementing the tree-planting project, installing educational signs and organising educational programmes for the public

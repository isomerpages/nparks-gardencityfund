Drawing its inspiration from forest habitats on the tropical mountains of Southeast Asia, the Mingxin Foundation Rambler’s Ridge brings visitors close to unique flora and fauna. Some of the environments in this region are known to be harsh, with poor soil and exposure to strong winds. Plants in these landscapes have evolved fascinating adaptations to thrive in such environments.

Through the exploration of the Rambler’s Ridge, visitors will get the opportunity to view some of these unique plants such as the Ant Plant, as well as the carnivorous Narrow-Lid Pitcher Plant and Raffles’ Pitcher Plant.

The ridge-top hiking trail on the Rambler’s Ridge provides adventure seekers access to one of the highest points in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Along the way, they will encounter trees that are Critically Endangered in Singapore, such as the Spike Oak and Braided Chestnut.

In partnership with **Toyota**
*
S$70,000 to build the first Outdoor Classroom at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.*

**About the Project**<Br>
Living in a City in Nature provides great opportunities for our children to make use of the natural environment to learn about eco systems and bring fun into science classes.

Designed to bring learning outdoors, the Outdoor Classroom, launched in April 2005, has benefited many schools and students by enabling educational activities.

The Outdoor Classroom is surrounded by five different habitats, namely, mangroves, back mangroves, secondary forest, herbs and spices garden, and a freshwater pond.

Toyota's contribution was used for the refurbishment of the facility and addition of field equipment such as stereomicroscopes, magnifying glasses and the production of various educational games and materials. Five participating schools created and designed these educational games and materials on Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.

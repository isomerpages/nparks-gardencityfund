The first of its kind in Singapore and in the region, this free-standing suspension bridge connects the two highest points in the Centre Catchment Nature Reserve.

The suspension bridge offers a bird's eye view of the forest canopy. One can also enjoy the panoramic view of the verdant greenery of the Nature Reserve and the placid waters of the Upper Peirce Reservoir.

The total length of the walkway is about 250 m and its height from the forest floor varies, with the highest point at 25 m.

The TreeTop Walk, besides providing another avenue for nature recreation for Singaporeans, also plays an important role in forest canopy research – an area many researchers were not able to study previously because of the lack of access.

HSBC and NParks established the HSBC-GCF TreeTop Walk Fund to support a host of programmes and activities for conservation, education and outreach, including programmes for school children, workshops for teachers, training of nature guides as well as the production of educational materials.

In partnership with **Sembcorp Industries** 

*S$10 million donation to rejuvenate the Tropical Montane Orchidetum, one of the National Orchid Garden’s key features.*

The Sembcorp Cool House provides more opportunities to grow and bring to flower rare orchids found naturally at higher elevations. It will also greatly benefit taxonomic and floristic research, as researchers will be able to grow rare species, before identifying and documenting them at a later stage when they flower. Not only will this help with conservation of the orchids, it will allow researchers more opportunities to hybridise orchid species naturally found in different habitats.

Designed to emulate a high elevation montane forest, the Sembcorp Cool House’s optimised indoor growing conditions reduce energy usage by about 30%, compared to previous systems. Energy-efficient installations include spectrally selective glass for the exterior to optimise the amount of sunlight entering, while reducing the amount of cooling required. Together with an improved misting system, this ensures the optimal level of humidity for the plants. 

In addition to monetary contributions, Sembcorp also partnered NParks to design programmes and tours led by their staff.

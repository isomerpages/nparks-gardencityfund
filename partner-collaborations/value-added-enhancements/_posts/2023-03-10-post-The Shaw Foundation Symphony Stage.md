*S$1.5 million to redevelop the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage.*

**About the Project**

The stage is an important icon and a much-loved feature in the Singapore Botanic Gardens since the 1990s. It has brought together a diversity of talents who entertained over millions of visitors.

In 2005, the stage was redeveloped at a cost of S$1.5 million to cater to a wider variety of performances.

Named the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage in appreciation of the sponsorship from the Shaw Foundation, it now features a bigger stage area, improved sound system, stage lighting and back-of-house facilities.

More than a concert venue, the Shaw Stage is also a civic sculpture. The design of the stage was inspired by its beautiful setting in the Palm Valley. The structure was built as two overlapping petal-like forms growing out of a floral stem, echoing the organic forms of flowers and leaves. The bigger petal shelters the stage while the smaller one at the rear houses the changing area and support services.

The petal-like form of the roof was constructed from free-standing steel ribs and clad with a titanium zinc roof to achieve the complex curvature. The ribbed texture of the roof also evokes the venation of flowers and leaves.

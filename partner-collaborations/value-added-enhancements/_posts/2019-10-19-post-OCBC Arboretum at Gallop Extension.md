In partnership with **OCBC**

*S$4 million for the development of and outreach programming at the OCBC Arboretum, home to 2,000 specimens of over 200 species of dipterocarps, and the upcoming Forest Discovery Centre @OCBC Arboretum.*

**About the project**
The OCBC Arboretum is a conservation project for trees of the family of Dipterocarpaceae. The work at the Arboretum may have an impact on climate action, as the 2,000 trees at the Arboretum alone can store 80 million kg of CO2 in their lifetimes!

Conservation, research and education are key focus areas of the OCBC Arboretum. It acts as a ‘gene bank’ for the dipterocarp species where the seeds produced from these trees will be used in forestation projects. The OCBC Arboretum will be instrumental to scientists’ understanding of dipterocarps, and provides students with an outdoor classroom to learn about conservation efforts as well as participate in forest restoration activities.

The generous donation by OCBC has enabled this first-of-its-kind high-tech arboretum in Southeast Asia,comprising a living library of trees with more than 200 species of dipterocarp saplings that will one day grow into forest giants!  

The Ecological Network of Tree Sensors (ENTS) uses remote sensing, environmental sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) to conduct ecological research, providing a scientific foundation for the OCBC Arboretum. The ENTS regularly measure trees growth and health in response to the environment, allowing us to collect more data to better understand and care for trees around Singapore.

Towering nearly 80 m high, Dipterocarps are iconic trees unique to this region and form the backbone of the Indo-Malayan rainforests. However, many of these forests have diminished over the years.

To highlight the biodiversity of these majestic giants in an urban area, Singapore's first Dipterocarp Arboretum was set up in Yishun Park. Showcasing more than 800 trees of over 70 species, the Arboretum serves as a living gallery of trees for education and research benefiting our community today and for generations to come.

Visitors to Yishun Park can learn more about this unique family of rainforest trees. The Arboretum is part of the NParks' initiative to enhance biodiversity in urban areas.

Banyan Tree's contribution supported the costs of implementing the project, installing educational signage, and organising educational programmes for the public, including guided walks and tree hunts. The arboretum was officially opened on 10 July 2008.

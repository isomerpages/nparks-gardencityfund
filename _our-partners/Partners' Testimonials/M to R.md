The other key initiative is our annual tree planting activity with Garden City Fund since 2007. Ricoh is also proud to have collaborated with NParks and Garden City Fund to develop a pocket park, called Tanjong Pagar Ricoh Park, above Tanjong Pagar MRT from 2005 to 2010. We look forward to continue our long term collaboration in engaging the community to connect with the natural heritage.</i>

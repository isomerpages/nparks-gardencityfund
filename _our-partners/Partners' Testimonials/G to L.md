**Grand Hyatt Singapore**<br>
Grand Hyatt Singapore, Public Relations Manager<br>
<i>In line with global Hyatt initiatives, Grand Hyatt Singapore is deeply committed to environmental stewardship through the work of our Green team. Through Hyatt Earth, the hotel is working toward protecting the natural habitats and environments in its communities like our partnership with National Parks Board, measuring results of natural resource conservation with the launch of the Trigeneration Plant, and improving efficiencies across operations by reducing energy and water use, greenhouse emissions and waste sent to landfills.</i>

**HSBC**<br>
HSBC, former Vice President, Public Affairs<br>
<i>At HSBC, caring for the environment is at the core of our view of corporate social responsibility. We are delighted to join hands with NParks to conduct a wide array of conservation and education projects such as the Young Naturalists Programme at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and the island-wide Heritage Trees Scheme to reach out to our young children and hopefully sow the seeds for an even greener generation. We are also very grateful to NParks for assisting us in our adoption of the Bukit Batok Nature Park and the development of a Green Volunteers Programme among our staff.</i>

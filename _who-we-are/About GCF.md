# Vision
Let's Make Singapore our City in Nature

# About Garden City Fund

Garden City Fund (GCF) is a registered charity and IPC in the Republic of Singapore. It was established in 2002 under our founding patron, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.  
  
GCF is established by the National Parks Board (NParks).  
  
100% of donations raised go towards projects it supports.  
  
These projects complement NParks' efforts towards fulfilling its City in Nature vision through:

*   Optimising the green spaces in Singapore
*   Supporting the urban biodiversity conservation model
*   Engaging the community
*   Enhancing competencies of the landscape industry in Singapore

Through partnerships with organisations and individuals, GCF provides a platform for the community to be involved in conservation, research, outreach and education initiatives.

By engaging the community, we hope to cultivate a love for the environment and promote a sense of ownership in our natural heritage.

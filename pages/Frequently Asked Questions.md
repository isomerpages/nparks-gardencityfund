<b>8. What is the Plant-A Tree Programme and how do I donate?</b><br>
The Plant-A-Tree Programme is a platform for organisations and individuals to actively participate in the greening of our City in Nature.

With a minimum donation of $300, you can plant one tree in our parks. This amount has been revised due to the increase in cost of trees, especially native trees.

For individual donations, check out the Plant-A-Tree schedule [here](https://gardencityfund.nparks.gov.sg/our-programmes/plant-a-tree/howtotakepart/)

For private donations with a minimum requirement of 50 trees, please send us an email at [garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg](mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg).

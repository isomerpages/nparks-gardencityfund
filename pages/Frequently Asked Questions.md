<b>4. Are donations to GCF eligible for tax-reduction?</b><br>

<b>5. Will I receive tax deduction receipt for my donation?</b><br>
In support of green efforts, we will not be issuing any receipts for donations received, unless upon request. If you have provided us with your details (Name/NRIC/FIN/UEN Number), we will submit your details and your donation details to IRAS.

On the basis of the foregoing, we will nevertheless review all refund requests on a case-by-case basis. Please write to&nbsp;[garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg](mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg)&nbsp;within 30 days from the date the donation was made.

<b>8. What is the Plant-A-Tree Programme and how do I donate?</b><br>
The Plant-A-Tree Programme is a platform for organisations and individuals to actively participate in the greening of our City in Nature.

With a minimum donation of $300, you can plant one tree in our parks. This amount has been revised due to the increase in cost of trees, especially native trees.

For individual donations, check out the Plant-A-Tree schedule&nbsp;[here](https://www.gardencityfund.gov.sg/our-programmes/plant-a-tree/howtotakepart/).

For private donations with a minimum requirement of 50 trees, please send us an email at&nbsp;[garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg](mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg).

<b>9. None of my questions were answered. How can I submit a query?</b><br>
Please write in to us at [garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg](mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg). Alternatively, you may submit your query via nparks.gov.sg/feedback.

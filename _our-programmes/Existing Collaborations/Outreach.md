<b>About the Project</b><br>
The Singapore Garden Festival is a biennial show, positioned to be among the top flower and garden shows on the international calendar. The Festival brings together the world's top award-winning garden and floral designers to Singapore to showcase their masterpieces. Singapore's geographic location makes the Festival an ideal platform to showcase horticultural and gardening products and services from Asia, Americas, Europe and Oceania. The Festival has attracted increasing number of visitors from Singapore and around the world since its inaugural show in 2006.  
  
Singapore Garden Festival has enjoyed extensive local and international media coverage. Our sponsors and partners have benefited from the intense media build-up in terms of brand awareness and reach to their target audiences. The Festival also provides a myriad of branding opportunities for companies seeking to connect with their audiences.

# Gift of Music Series at the Singapore Botanic Gardens
<b>Partnership</b><br>
* **Singapore Press Holdings**<br>
S$202,000 to fund a year-long concert series for the community.

<b>About the Project</b><br>
The Gift of Music Series in 2005 was SPH's contribution towards enriching the community with music through a year-long series of concerts held monthly at the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, and other venues.

It enabled the spread of the appreciation of music and at the same time leveraged on the Shaw Stage as a concert platform for home grown musicians and budding young performers to showcase their talents.

The concert performances showcased diverse genres, ranging from jazz, Latin, and light classical to pop, R&B and Chinese orchestral music.

The addition of such outreach activities attracted more people to visit the Gardens and provided them with an enhanced experience.

# Nature Keeper Programme
-----------------------
<b>Partnership</b><br>
* **Mitsubishi Corporation**<br>
S$55,000 to fund the Programme

<b>About the Project</b><br>
The Nature Keeper Programme was the first programme in Singapore to target primary school students with a focus on our local forests and its flora and fauna.

The two-year programme (2010-2012) brought students through a series of theoretical and field workshops on eight topics. These topics covered the impact of the release of animals in nature reserves, the native plants and animals unique to Singapore, the importance of forests in regulating climate, and more.

Designed to stimulate the interest of the young and inculcate in them an appreciation of our forests, the programme was carried out at the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves.

# Migratory Birds of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (Publication)
-------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Partnership</b><br>
* **Grand Hyatt Singapore**<br>
S$14,731 (USD$10,000) to fund the cost of producing and printing the Migratory Birds of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (1st edition).

<b>About the Project</b><br>
Singapore is a transit hub for travellers of all kinds â€“ even avian ones. The migratory birds seen at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve are now featured in a guidebook. This is the first comprehensive photographic guide on migratory birds to be published in Singapore.

An ASEAN Heritage Park, the Wetland Reserve is sited along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership, making it a unique asset for conservation, education and recreation in a land-scarce city-state. It is also home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including over 220 species of birds.

The first edition of the guidebook documents 108 species of migratory birds which have been sighted at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, with photos and descriptions of their behaviour. It is a useful resource to complement tours, workshops and talks at the Wetland Reserve, and will help visitors to learn about and appreciate these fascinating birds.

In addition, Hyatt also supported the project by providing guided tours of SBWR for their hotel guests led by their staff volunteers.

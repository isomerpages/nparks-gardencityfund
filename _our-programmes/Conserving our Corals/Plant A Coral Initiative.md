<p>The corals in Singapore’s waters are vulnerable to various impact from
climate change. The Garden City Fund’s 100k Corals Initiative is a platform
for organisations and individuals to support habitat enhancement efforts
to improve coral reef cover and resilience.</p>
<p>Coral nubbins (small coral fragments) will be transplanted from the Marine
Park Outreach and Education Centre (MPOEC) coral culturing facility to
degraded or artificial reefs. This aims to enhance our marine biodiversity
by increasing coral abundance and diversity.</p>
<p>In December 2024, NParks launched the 100k Corals Initiative to scale
up existing coral restoration efforts and plant 100,000 corals in Singapore’s
waters. Each transplanted coral nubbin will contribute towards this ambitious
target.</p>

<h2>Importance of coral conservation</h2>
<p>Corals are keystone reef-building animals that support a marine ecosystem,
and an estimated one-quarter of marine species depend on coral reefs to
survive. They are also a potential nature-based solution to help mitigate
the impacts of climate change, serving as a natural defence against shoreline
erosion while providing habitats for a rich array of marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>Hence, to safeguard this valuable ecosystem, it is imperative to scale
up coral restoration efforts locally, which will contribute towards a high-quality
living environment in our City in Nature.</p>

The corals in Singapore’s waters are vulnerable to impact from climate change. The Garden City Fund’s Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef (PACSAR) Programme is a platform for organisations and individuals to support habitat enhancement efforts to improve coral reef cover and resilience.

Coral nubbins (small coral fragments) will be transplanted from a coral nursery to degraded or artificial reefs. This aims to enhance our marine biodiversity by providing areas for marine organisms to grow and reef fish to seek refuge.

In June 2023, NParks announced a new initiative to scale up existing coral restoration efforts and plant 100,000 corals in Singapore’s waters under PACSAR. Each transplanted coral nubbin will contribute towards this ambitious target.

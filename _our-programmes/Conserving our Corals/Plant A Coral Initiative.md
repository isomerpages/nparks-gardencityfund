<p>The corals in Singapore’s waters are vulnerable to impact from climate
change. The Garden City Fund’s Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef&nbsp;(PACSAR)
Programme is a platform for organisations and individuals to support habitat
enhancement efforts to improve coral reef cover and resilience.</p>
<p>Coral nubbins (small coral fragments) will be transplanted from a coral
nursery to degraded or artificial reefs. This aims to enhance our marine
biodiversity by providing areas for marine organisms to grow and reef fish
to seek refuge.</p>
<p>In June 2023, NParks announced a new initiative to scale up existing coral
restoration efforts and plant 100,000 corals in Singapore’s waters under
PACSAR. Each transplanted coral nubbin will contribute towards this ambitious
target.</p>

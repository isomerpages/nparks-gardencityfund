Did you know that every flowering plant, from the diminutive orchids to the tallest trees on earth, begins life as a seed? Seeds come in all shapes and sizes, and contain tiny plant embryos that will grow to become the next generation of plants.  
  
The Singapore Botanic Gardens Seed Bank is dedicated to conserving seeds of threatened plant species in Southeast Asia due to climate change and habitat loss. With the capacity to store seeds up to 25,000 species of plants, the Seed Bank seeks to advance research in seed conservation and storage.

Did you know Singapore is home to a large variety of animal and plant species? We have at least 2,100 species of native vascular plants and more than 390 species of birds. In the waters of Singapore, there are at least 250 species of hard corals, over 200 species of sea sponges, 120 species of reef fish and other invertebrates.

Some of these species, like the Hawksbill Turtle, Sunda Pangolin and Blue-rumped Parrot, are endangered. These species play an important role in their respective ecosystems to ensure that the nature and biodiversity in Singapore continue to thrive.Â 

It is our duty to conserve the habitats of these species for the benefit of Singapore's natural heritage, and our future generations.

<p>From 2025 - 2027, the Singapore Botanic Gardens will be embarking on its
plans to digitalise the Singapore Herbarium (SING), to provide online access
to our botanical collections and safeguard valuable specimen data against
potential loss or damage.</p>
<h2>Why this project is important</h2>
<p>Digitalising the Herbarium provides access to botanical collections, enabling
accurate plant identification, advancing diverse research fields, and protecting
valuable specimen data. Here’s why the Herbarium matters to all of us!</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Human life is fully dependent on plants; Precise plant names are essential
for accurate communication, effective use and conservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Herbaria are the guardians of specimens on which plant names are based
around the world; SING is a key herbarium in our region, housing amazing
collections of specimens gathered across Southeast Asia for over 230 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data derived from digitised specimens and their associated labels
provide basis for future research, including studies on climate change
and wild crop relatives, both of which are crucial to our future survival,
impacting food security as well as the ecological and other services plants
provide to humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dead plants can still “communicate” – For example, genetic information
can be extracted from their DNA – even from extinct species collected hundreds
of years ago!</p>
</li>

<h2>What digitalisation of the Herbarium achieves:</h2>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Seamless plant data management:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>High-resolution digital images and detailed metadata allow researchers
to examine specimens more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports research in biodiversity conservation, species discovery, species
distribution, phenology (flowering and fruiting patterns), plant adaptation
to climate change, and crop wild relatives for food security.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced research capabilities:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Digital records allow better storage, organisation, and retrieval of pictorial
and textual plant data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced data analytics of AI pattern recognition improves and automates
species identification and taxonomic classification</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global research equity and accessibility:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A digitalised herbarium is easily accessible to researchers, students
and even the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Globally democratises access to valuable botanical resources.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection of valuable botanical information:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Safeguards valuable botanical data by providing a backup of the information.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a Herbarium?</h2>
<p>A herbarium is a specialised research facility that houses a curated collection
of preserved plant and fungi specimens. Amassed over a long period of time
from many different places, this ever-growing collection provides a snapshot
of a species’ presence at a specific time and location.</p>
<p>Established in 1875 by Henry James Murton, the first Superintendent of
the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Singapore Herbarium (SING) has since
evolved from a small office collection to the second-largest herbarium
in Southeast Asia, with approximately 800,000 specimens of plant and fungi.
Its invaluable collections played a key role in securing the UNESCO World
Heritage status for the Gardens in 2015.</p>

<h2>What it takes to digitalise a herbarium and how my donation helps</h2>
<p>Digitalising a herbarium is a complex process. Your donation will go towards
bringing in technology that will enable the Singapore Herbarium to be fully
digitalised by 2027. You will also be supporting research and conservation
work undertaken by the Singapore Botanic Gardens and other researchers
who use the Singapore Herbarium (SING) as an invaluable resource of botany
information.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each of the approximately 800,000 physical plant and fungi specimens has
to be photographed or scanned in ultra-high definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accompanying the digital copy of each specimen is a set of metadata, including
the scientific name, collection date, location and collector of the specimen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the digitised specimens, a data management system is developed
to store and manage the vast collection. This enables the plant data to
be categorised, arranged and easily searched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The collection has to be updated continuously when new specimens are collected
or new information is obtained.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can observe the digitisation process through a live viewing gallery
later this year, offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at this meticulous
work. Stay tuned for more details!</p>

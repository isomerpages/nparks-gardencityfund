With every donation of $300, organisations and individuals will be able to plant a tree in one of NParks-managed green spaces. 

[](mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg)Your donation will support the cost of the tree and site preparation. Any balance would go towards helping outreach and education programmes connect our local community with our natural heritage. 

*   **Step 1:** Check the tree planting schedule below.
*   **Step 2:** Donate **[here](https://www.giving.sg/garden-city-fund/plantatreeprogramme)** or via cheque.

For cheque donations, complete the form in Step 2 above, and mail the cheque, payable to **Garden City Fund**, with your full name and purpose of donation written at the back of the cheque, to:

<b>Garden City Fund  
c/o National Parks Board HQ  
1 Cluny Road  
Singapore 259569 </b>


Your donation will entitle you to a 2.5 times tax deduction, with a valid NRIC/FIN number (individual) or local UEN/Business Registration Number (organisation). Donation details will be filed with IRAS and automatically reflected in your tax assessment the following year. To support the environment, we will issue e-tax deductible receipts only upon request.

We will send you a confirmation email when we have received your donation.

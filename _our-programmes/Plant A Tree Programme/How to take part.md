<p>With every donation of $300, organisations and individuals will be able
to plant a tree in one of NParks-managed green spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your donation will support the cost of the tree and site preparation.
Any balance would go towards community and capacity building projects (e.g.
education, research, value-added features, outreach, etc) that helps connect
people with nature, moving us closer to realising our City in Nature vision,
a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest to support the Plant-A-Tree programme.</p>
<p>Your $300 donation enables you to plant a tree in one of NParks-managed
green spaces. This contribution covers not just the tree and site preparation,
but also supports vital community and capacity building initiatives - from
education and research to outreach programmes. These efforts help strengthen
people's connection with nature, advancing our <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/who-we-are/city-in-nature-key-strategiesCi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">City in Nature</a> vision
under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>
<p>Your donation also qualifies for a 2.5 times tax deduction, provided you
provide us with a valid NRIC/FIN number (for individuals) or local UEN/Business
Registration Number (for organisations) within 5 working days of making
your donation. We will file your donation details directly with IRAS, and
these will be automatically reflected in your tax assessment the following
year.</p>
<p>As part of our environmental commitment since 2018, we no longer issue
physical receipts. However, if you would like an e-receipt, please email
your request to <a href="mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg</a>.</p>

or would like to feedback on the new process, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">garden_city_fund@nparks.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Please take note of the following terms and conditions applicable to this
programme:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you wish to take part in the tree planting, please donate through the
NParks booking website using the booking link provided in the planting
schedule above.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Maximum 6 trees per registration on NParks booking system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For more trees, you can make multiple bookings if slots are available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If slots are full, consider booking for another month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, if you want 10 trees, you'll need to make two separate bookings:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First booking: 6 trees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second booking: 4 trees</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please book early as slots fill up quickly.</p>
</li>

<p>To join our tree planting activities, donations must be made through the

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>This ensures trees are planted promptly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protects trees already delivered to site</p>

<li>
<p>Pevents resource strain on the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensures smooth operation of planting schedule</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate your understanding of this policy as it helps us maintain
the programme's effectiveness and protect the trees.</p>

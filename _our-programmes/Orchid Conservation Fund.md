**Our native orchids need you!**<br>
Singapore was once home to 229 species of native wild orchids. More than two thirds of them - 170 of them – to be precise are now extinct, and have disappeared forever.

You may not realise that out of the remaining 59 native orchids, 54 are either critically endangered or rare and only 5 are common.

**Ensuring the survival of our native orchids**<br>
With the help of local orchid experts at the National Parks Board, Garden City Fund started an Orchid Conservation Fund to raise some $250,000 to save our native orchids.
